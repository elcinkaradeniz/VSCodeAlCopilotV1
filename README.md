# Visual Studio Code AI Copilot

I am relatively new to writing TypeScript (I can say I learned a bit while working on the project), so there might be mistakes in what I've done. I am open to any suggestions; please note that the project was completed in 2 days, hence it has limited features.

# Usage:
The content within the "help" tag serves as help text for a specific question. This text contains an explanation of the user's asked question and is embedded as comments, depending on the programming language.

The content within the "code" tag represents the code block corresponding to a question. This code, which is the answer to the user's posed problem, is inserted at a specific location within the text editor.

The content within the "fix" tag represents a request for fixing an error. The user specifies a piece of code containing an error with this tag, and the corrected version of this code is inserted at a specific location within the text editor.

The "fixAll" tag contains the corrected versions of all faulty code in the entire document. By using this tag, a user can request the automatic correction of all errors.

These tags represent instructions from the user to perform specific actions, and they are processed based on where they are defined in the document.
